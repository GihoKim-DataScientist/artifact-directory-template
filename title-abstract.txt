Title:
Selecting the Most Profitable Freight Offer

Abstract:
The freight industry has become a critical part of the economy ever since the outbreak of COVID-19 due to its significant impact on the supply chain and the delivery of essential goods. Flock Freight is a technology-enabled logistics company that aims to revolutionize the freight industry by providing cost-effective shipping methods. The company uses proprietary machine learning algorithms that take in the rich data which the company has gathered in previous years to combine less-than-truckload shipments into one truckload to improve efficiency and reduce potential costs. As a method of minimizing shipping costs, Flock Freight puts customers' orders to an auction so that freight companies compete with each other to ship orders at lower rates â€“ the company needs to accept a good offer before the freight company withdraws the offer. The research team wants to develop a machine learning model that identifies offers with the best rate before it expires or the pickup deadline for the order approaches. The team suggests a two-part hybrid model that consists of a regression model that predicts minimum offer rates and a classification model that predicts the number of offers for each order. The hybrid model then decides whether to accept an offer or not. With the model, Flock Freight can make informed decisions and reduce the overall costs of shipments.
